The code is for directed graph embedding using deepwalk, LINE, node2vec

## file
split_dataset.bash: split the dataset

run_deepwalk.bash: using deepwalk to generate embedding

run_node2vec.bash: using node2vec to generate embedding

run_LINE.bash: using LINE to generate embedding

**recall_in_out.xlsx: evaluation results of the embedding**

## dir
output: the dir to save the embedding matrix which is word2vec format and to save the recall in and recall out results

dataset: to save raw and processed dataset
