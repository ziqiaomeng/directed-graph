The code is for directed graph embedding

./split_dataset.bash: split the dataset

./run_deepwalk.bash: using deepwalk to generate embedding

./run_node2vec.bash: using node2vec to generate embedding

./run_LINE.bash: using LINE to generate embedding

./output: the dir to save the embedding matrix which is word2vec format

../dataset: to save raw and processed dataset, to save the recall in and recall out results
